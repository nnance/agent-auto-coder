# Agent Auto Coder

This project is an experimental tool that leverages Anthropic's Agent SDK to automatically generate code based on user requirements. It utilizes the Anthropic API to power its AI capabilities.

This agent is designed to take high-level specifications and implement them in code, streamlining the development process and reducing manual coding effort.  The agent runs in non-interactive mode, making it suitable for automated workflows.

## Features

- Automatic code generation from user requirements
- Integration with Anthropic's Agent SDK
- Non-interactive operation for seamless automation
